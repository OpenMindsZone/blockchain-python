- [Business Requirements](project_docs/BR.md)
- [Technical description](project_docs/TD.md)

## Running environment
- Development language: [Python 3.11](https://www.python.org/). 
- Virtual environment nt manager: [Poetry 1.1.12](https://python-poetry.org/)


### Python virtual environments
Why is it paramount to use a virtual environment manager in Python?
- Please have a look at a very nice explanation [here](https://towardsdatascience.com/why-you-should-use-a-virtual-environment-for-every-python-project-c17dab3b0fd0).
- There is several different tools to manage a Python virtual environment. For an overview about some of them and some help on which one to choose, we can have a look at [here](https://blog.inedo.com/python/python-environment-management-best-practices/).


## Source
Paraphrasing [Sir Isaac Newton](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Isaac_Newton), "to be able to see further, we have to [stand on the shoulders of the giants](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Standing_on_the_shoulders_of_giants)".  
So, the backbone of this P.O.C. was inspired by [this nice article](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/create-simple-blockchain-using-python/) at GeeksForGeeks site.
